# Taskwork
## Description
A user-friendly project management tool that utilizes the scrum framework, allowing users to track project tasks, review those in flight and boost team efficiency.

## Motivation
The primary driver behind Taskwork is to deliver a project-management tool with a relatively low barrier to entry. Taskwork is designed to be easy to navigate with special attention given to a fluid UI/UX experience. In addition, a completly responsive, mobile-first design allows users to track projects on the go.

## How to use
After logging in, users create projects on the Project Page where they can add descriptions and track the overall status of the project. Each project is linked to its own task page, where users can add tasks, advance tasks through different statuses of completion: To Do, In Progress, In Testing and Complete, from where users can move the projects to new states for another team to review the project. Once the In Review team is happy, the project can be moved to Complete once all project requirements have been met and approved.
